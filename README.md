## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Truong Gia Bao (people tend to call me Bao), a current third-year student, pursuing Computer Science at VinUniversity.
- I spent my high school years immersed in math olympiadsâ€”now Iâ€™m a wannabe applied scientist, turning research into code to build real-world solutions.
- In my spare time, I dive into all kinds of curious cornersâ€”music, game theory, philosophy, politics, physics, even a bit of literature. Becoming a polymath is my favorite side quest.
