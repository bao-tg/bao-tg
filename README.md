## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Truong Gia Bao (people tend to call me Bao), a current third-year student, pursuing Computer Science at VinUniversity.
- I spent my high school years immersed in math olympiadsâ€”now Iâ€™m a wannabe applied scientist, turning research into code to build real-world solutions.
- In my spare time, I dive into all kinds of curious cornersâ€” poker, music, game theory, philosophy, politics, physics, even a bit of literature. Becoming a polymath is my favorite side quest.

## Fun facts
- I used to be a vocalist in a band at my university (Although I'm not good at singing, thanks to my band for carrying me along, lol).
- In my high school, I learned Chinese Chess in 2 weeks (I played with my father/uncles a lot, but never learn it seriously), and got the first place in the school tournament (never have a chance to compete in provincial/national tournament, but probably try in the future).
